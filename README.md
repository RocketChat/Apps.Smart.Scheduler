<h1 align="center">Smart Scheduling App</h1>

Smart scheduling app is an assistant tailored for meetings, reminders, and schedules. It is connected with Google Calendar via function calling so you can query and create meetings directly from Rocket.Chat app.

To create a meeting, you have to trigger `/schedule` and a pop up modal will appear. You have to specify the prompt and the participants of the meeting.

If you are not happy with the preference, you can redo it by using `/schedule retry`. However, if you still unsatisfied, you can pick the time manually by using `/schedule pick`.

Example prompt: _Could you arrange a meeting for the next Wednesday? We need to discuss about the new AI projects, and I would prefer an early slot for fresher mind._

Setting a reminder is similar to the previous one, you have to trigger `/schedule` and a pop up modal will appear and you have to fill the form. Unlike the previous one, this feature does not care about the schedule of the participants.

Example prompt: _Remind me 23 September 2024 for a GSOC submission at 09.00_
